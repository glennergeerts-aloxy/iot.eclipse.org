      <description>Intel® System Studio is based on the Eclipse CDT project and offers a comprehensive set of tools under a free and renewable licensing model. This software suite allows you to build, debug, analyze and optimize applications and can be used throughout the entire development cycle from hardware bring-up to deploying the final product. During this presentation, we will introduce you to Intel® System Studio and show how to develop and debug IoT and systems applications.</description>

      <description>Eclipse VOLTTRON provides an environment for agent execution and serves as a single point of contact for interfacing with devices (rooftop units, building systems, meters, etc.), external resources, and platform services such as data archival and retrieval. VOLTTRON applications are referred to as agents since VOLTTRON provides an agent-based programming paradigm to ease application development and minimize the lines of code that need to be written by domain experts such as buildings engineers.</description>

      <description>This presentation focuses primarily on the MRAA and UPM middleware projects which have been a part of the Intel IoT Developer Kits since day 1 and are now proudly joining the Eclipse IoT community. The MRAA library provides an abstraction layer for several Intel and non-Intel IoT platforms, offering C/C++, Java, JavaScript, and Python bindings to the physical pins and buses. This is subsequently used by the UPM sensor library for exposing standardized APIs intended to simplify the interaction between developers and peripherals, with virtually over 400 different specialized sensors, actuators and radio modules currently supported as part of the project.</description>

      <description>This talk will survey the current open source options for an operating system to use (like Linux, FreeRTOS, Zephyr, mbedOS, RIOT, NuttX, etc.) in your IoT Constrained Device Stack. Factors to consider in selection include chip/hardware support, licensing, footprint, community health, open source best practices, security support as well as safety certifications available, all play roles.</description>

      <description>We introduce YAKS which is actually not « Yet Another Key-value Store » per se, but a framework offering a unified view similar to a key-value store of distributed and heterogeneous data storages. A YAKS infrastructure allows the deployment of various data storages at any point of the system (cloud, edge or in the devices themselves) and to query or subscribe to the data from any point of the system in a location-transparent way.</description>

      <description>We followed the Eclipse IoT software evolution and found it appropriate to incorporate it in our software architecture. We implemented our solution using two main Eclipse projects, namely Eclipse Kapua and Eclipse Kura. Our end-to-end architecture involves these two modules at its core, forming the most essential parts of our lighting solution.</description>
